\underline{Bad MDP Decomposition} (worst possible case)\\

result -- no impact on reward directly

\underline{Latent reality}: move system into a position of advantage through actions

example of `'bad MDP'' which, in isolation, is useless


ways to understand:

analyze actions of subsystem

analyze effectiveness of subsystem
Do until ave coordination

only abilty: coordinate acting with subsystem, s.t., an understanding of the relationship of your action \& subsystem action arises
